# Diabetes-prediction
This Diabetes Prediction project uses machine learning to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on health-related features such as age, glucose level, and blood pressure. The model, built with Logistic Regression, is trained, evaluated, and optimized using scikit-learn, providing a tool for early diabetes detection.
